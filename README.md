>The Climber KPI is fully responsive and works for all screen sizes. Features include background trends for both actual and target, navigation and tooltip on hover to show values. It is also possible to include images as background or use the extension just to show images. Colors are completely flexible but have easy standard settings to allow quick and easy creation of nice looking KPIs. For more details take a look at the video found here: https://youtu.be/9zdfYshNel4

***Tested from Qlik Sense June 2017 (in the initial release of June 2017, extensions load slow. It's fixed in patch 1 )***

## Most recent update 1.6.2 - 2019-03-12

## Purpose and Description
The Climber KPI extension brings a clear presentation of KPIs including trendlines and navigation from your dashboard to details on other sheets. Getting started is extremely quick when using Master Items.

The large number of options for the layout including the possibility to use an image background allows a flexible layout. Finetuning of graphs, colors and even margins are possible in the extensive settings menu.

## Getting started
To get started (after installation) add one or two measures. To get the trendline, add a dimension in the Trend section of the extension settings. 

## Settings and Features
1. Target Mode - Target mode includes feedback on target fulfillment. This may include both color and icon. The target mode setting is found in the "Target" section of the settings.

2. Layout Mode - Choose between Fill or Top. Settings are located in Appearance/Layout.   
<img src="./screenshots/screenshot_FillTopMode.png?raw=true" alt="Fill or Top Layout Mode" />
3. Text Layouts - Choose text layout you like. Or remove the text altogether for just graphs, icons or images. (Works well to use for navigation too!)  
<img src="./screenshots/screenshot_TextLayoutModes.png?raw=true" alt="Text Layout Alternatives" />
4. Hover modes - Select what you want to show "on mouse over" the object. This is also where you enable navigation mode. The setting is found in Appearance/Hover.  
<img src="./screenshots/screenshot_HoverModes.png?raw=true" alt="Hover mode alternatives" />
5. Color settings - Full control of color settings for both text and trend. You can choose to have quick access to banding for Target color mode (two or three colors) or you can use an expression to set the Target color. The trend color is independent of the target (icon) color and can also be set either to a specific color or an expression.

6. When new versions of the extensions are released it is now possible to update (rather than recreate) the object to include any new properties. This will improve the maintainability of the extension between versions.
